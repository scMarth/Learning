Block, Element, Modifier methodology is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS.

In this CSS methodology, a 'block' is a top-level abstraction of a new component, for example, a button:

.btn{}

This block should be thought of as a parent.

Child items, or 'elements,' can be placed inside and these are denoted by two underscores following the name of the block like:

    .btn__price{}

'Modifiers' can manipulate the block so that we can theme or style that particular component without inflicting changes on a completely unrelated module. This is done by appending two hyphens to the name of the block like:

    .btn--orange

example 1:

    <a class="btn btn--big btn--orange" href="http://css-tricks.com">
      <span class="btn__price">$9.99</span>
      <span class="btn__text">Subscribe</span>
    </a>

example 2:

    <figure class="photo">
      <img class="photo__img photo__img--framed" src="me.jpg">
      <figcaption class="photo__caption photo__caption--large">Look at me!</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <style>
      .photo__img--framed {
        /* incremental style changes */
      }
      .photo__caption--large {
        /* incremental style changes */
      }
    </style>

Multi-word Names

    BEM names intentionally use double underscores and double hyphens instead of single to separate Block-Element-Modifier. The reason is so that single hyphens can be used as word separators. Class names should be very readable, so abbreviation isnâ€™t always desirable unless the abbreviations are universally recognizable.

example 3:

    <!-- DO THIS -->
    <div class="some-thesis some-thesis--fast-read">
      <div class="some-thesis__some-element"></div>
    </div>

    <style>
      .some-thesis { }
      .some-thesis--fast-read { }
      .some-thesis__some-element { }
    </style>

    <!-- DON'T DO THIS -->
    // These class names are harder to read
    <div class="somethesis somethesis--fastread">
      <div class="somethesis__someelement"></div>
    </div>

    <style>
      .somethesis { }
      .somethesis--fastread { }
      .somethesis__someelement { }
    </style>
