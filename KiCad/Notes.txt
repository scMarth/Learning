File > New Project > 

the first step in PCB design is drawing the schematic or "capturing" the schematic

in the right toolbar, click "Add a symbol". In the menu that pops up, you can search for various symbols, e.g. STM32F103

left-click to place the symbol

right-click > properties on the name to change it

click on the ground symbol and search for "GND" for ground

place the ground symbol

hover over a pin and press "w" to wire a pin

press "esc" to stop pin wiring mode

VSS is ground supply for the digital side
VSSA is the ground reference for the analog side
generally you want these tied to the same ground, although there are some exceptions

for +3.3V, go to power (ground symbol in panel) and search for "+3.3V"

one 100nF decoupling capacitor per pin, one bulk? decoupling capacitor for the whole IC

stop @ 13:00, didn't add VDDA bypass caps
