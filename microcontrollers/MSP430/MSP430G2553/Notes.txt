      Set SEL and SEL2 both to 0 to use I/O
      Set I/O direction with P1DIR
      Read I/O with P1IN
      Set output with P1OUT

   PxDIR    PxREN    PxOUT    I/O Config
   0        0        X        Input with resistors disabled
   0        1        0        Input with Internal Pulldown enabled
   0        1        1        Input with Internal Pullup enabled
   1        X        X        Output â€“ PxREN has no effect

   So you should only set the pins that you are using

   You can't use pulldown for push buttons:

         "What is so unexpected? The push button will pull the P1.1 input down to ground when pressed. With the internal pull ups enabled this causes the P1.1 input state to change. With a pull down enabled, nothing happens."
