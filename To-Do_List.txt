    53. Maximum Subarray (Leetcode)

    Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

    Example:

    Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
    Follow up:

    If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

    class Solution(object):
        def maxSubArray(self, nums):
            """
            :type nums: List[int]
            :rtype: int
            """
            largestSum = nums[0]
            largestSumArray = [nums[0]] # ith element is the largest sum that can be made using values to the left of i
            for i in range(1, len(nums)):
                if largestSumArray[i-1] + nums[i] > nums[i]:
                    largestSumArray.append(largestSumArray[i-1] + nums[i])
                else:
                    largestSumArray.append(nums[i])
                largestSum = max(largestSumArray[i], largestSum)
            return largestSum
