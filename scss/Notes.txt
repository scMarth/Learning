.scss is Sassy CSS and is the next generation of .sass

Sass has two syntaxes. The most commonly used syntax is known as SCSS for "Sassy CSS," and is a superset of CSS3's syntax. This means that every valid CSS3 stylesheet is a valid SCSS as well. SCSS file use the extension .scss.

The second older syntax is known as the indented syntax (or just ".sass"). Inspired by Haml's terseness, it's intended for people who prefer conciseness over similarity to CSS. Instead of brackets and semicolons, it uses the indentation of lines to specify blocks. Files in the indented syntax use the extension .sass"
