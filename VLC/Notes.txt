Enable high definition upscaling:
    tools > preferences > video > show all settings > video > filters > check video post processing filter
        put the code in the field: postproc:swscale:sharpen

        under filters, set sharpen filter to: 0.250
        postproc: post processing quality set to 3
            (it seems that if you set this too high, VLC will crash for some videos?)
        swscale: Lanczos
