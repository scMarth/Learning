The OpenDataSoft API documentation states that using GET requests is recommended over using POST requests.

    "This API supports the GET method. The POST method is supported as well, however its use is advised against for standardization reasons."

Various methods of POST requests using xmlhttprequests seem to fail.

Setting up geocoding given data with lat / long:

There is a /data.json at the root of any ODS domain:
    https://cityofsalinas.opendatasoft.com/data.json

    More info on data.json harvester:

    Some information contained in the json:
        dataset info
            identifier
            type (dcat?)
            description
            landing page
            access level - seems to show whether or not it's restricted

        basically just metadata... it does help with crawling though, since they have identifiers
