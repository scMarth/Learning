If you try to query above id 10,000:

    https://leicester.opendatasoft.com/api/records/1.0/search/?dataset=planning-permissions&rows=10000&start=10000&facet=ward_description&facet=decision_description&facet=application_type&facet=perm_expiry_date&facet=appeal_decision_date&facet=decision_date

You will get an error:

    {
        "error": "The sum of `start` + `rows` parameters can not be more than 10000. Please refine your query or use the Download service."
    }


According to https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-search-v1/#record-search-api :
    Note also that the cumulated value of the parameters start and rows cannot go over 10 000. It means that with the Records Search API, there's no way to access a result with a position greater than 10 000. If however you need to do so, consider again using the Records Download API.
