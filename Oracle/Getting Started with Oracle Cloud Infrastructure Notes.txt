Regions
    Availability Domain (independent from each other)
        Fault Domain (3 per availability domain)

OCI = Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

OCI Compute Services = servers / compute instances


types of compute
    virtual machine - virtual machine running on shared servers
    bare metal - dedicated server infra
    dedicated vm host - run vm on dedicated server

shapes - template that determines the resources allocated to an instance (CPUs, memory)
    amd, intel, arm-based processors

fixed shapes
    can't be customized
flexible shapes
    can change but only on virtual machines

vertical scaling - give more resources to a VM
autoscaling (horizontal scaling) - adding more VMs / compute instances
    enable large scale deployment

    metric based autoscaling - choose a metric to monitor and increase or decrease VMs based on that metric (e.g. memory?)
    scheduled-based autoscaling - e.g. anticipate higher usage during a busy time

3 main types of storage services
    block volumes - storage for compute
        always persistent (virtual disk / storage drive)
    file storage - like a network drive, shared for multiple compute instaces
    object storage - storage for web (images, video)
        buckets (like folders)
region
    virtual cloud network (VCN)
        public subnet
        private subnet

security:
    oracle manages:
        physical hosts
        physical network
        physical data center
    you configure:
        data
        devices
        accounts and identities
        applications
        network controls
        operating system

infrastructure protection
    ddos protection
    network security controls
    virtual firewalls
    filter malicious web traffic

    ddos protection
    web application firewall
    security lists / NSG
    network firewall
identity and access management
    IAM - grant access to resource
        user accounts, groups
    MFA
    federation
    audit
os and workload protection
    bastion - secure way to access target resources / private networks
    os management - monitor os patches
data protection
    vault key / vault secrets
    data safe
    certificates
detection remediation
    cloud guard - cloud native service
    vulnerability scanning

oracle public cloud
    standard compute

autonomous database
    automates backups
    patching
    upgrading / tuning

    without human intervention

mysql heatwave
    fully managed database service - enables customers to run OLTP / OLAP applications directly from their mysql database

    accelerates mysql queries by 400x
