If multiprocessing isn't used, CPU doesn't get fully utilized.

Why? Because of the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), originally put there as a memory management safeguard.

Multiprocessing allows you to utilize multiple processes.

It seems that a process that puts a lot of data on a multiprocessing queue will still technically be alive
until that queue's contents are cleared on the parent process

In the above case, when you do a queue.get() from the parent thread, the very next line after the queue.get(), the
process corresponding to that queue item may more may not be alive according to process.is_alive()

Having a process p and then calling p.join() and/or p.terminate() multiple times seems to not cause any problems

If a process is killed / suddenly exits before it finishes its job, it causes a multiprocessing pool to hang..
