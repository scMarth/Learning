    Arcade: portable, lightweight, and secure expression language written for use in ArcGIS

    portable - write, share, and execute expressions across ArcGIS

    lightweight - runs in ArcGIS with minimal impact

    secure - no executable code

    expression language - write statements which return results you can use


    operatiors:
        mathematical: + - * /
        increment: i++ --j
        comparison: == !=
        logical: && ||

    
    For (var i = 0; i < MaxVal; i++){
        /* code block */
    }
