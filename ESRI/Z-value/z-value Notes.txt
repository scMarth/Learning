    When recording altitude, Field Maps records orthometric height based on the geoid model of your receiver (often EGM96, but see your device's user manual). If you require a different geoid model, postprocess the values to use the required geoid model.

    Your receiver is now providing locations to Field Maps. As you collect data, you will provide your organization with high-accuracy data that meets its standards.

    Does WGS 84 Define a Geoid?

        WGS 84 does not define a geoid. It only defines a reference ellipsoid, which is a smooth, mathematical model of Earth's shape used for global positioning. GPS devices typically measure height relative to the ellipsoid (ellipsoidal height) rather than to the geoid (orthometric height).
    
        To derive orthometric height (true elevation above sea level), you would need a geoid model that provides the separation (geoid height) between the ellipsoid and the geoid.

    Are There Spatial References or Standards for Different Geoids?
        Yes, there are specific models and standards for geoids, but they are separate from the ellipsoid-based spatial references. Geoids are used in combination with ellipsoids to calculate orthometric heights. Common geoid models include:

            EGM96 (Earth Gravitational Model 1996) and EGM2008: These are global geoid models that can be used in conjunction with ellipsoids like WGS 84.
    
            GEOID18: A U.S.-specific geoid model used by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) for high-accuracy elevations.
    
            GRS 80 Geoid: Often used with the GRS 80 Ellipsoid, which is similar to WGS 84 but primarily used in North America.
    

    Ellipsoid Height (h): The height of a point measured from the reference ellipsoid. This is what GPS devices typically calculate.

    Geoid Height (N): The vertical distance between the ellipsoid and the geoid. It indicates how much the geoid deviates from the ellipsoid due to variations in Earth's gravity.

    Orthometric Height (H) = Ellipsoid Height (h) − Geoid Height (N)



    Ellipsoidal Height (h):

    This is the height measured from the reference ellipsoid used by a particular geodetic system, such as WGS 84. The ellipsoid is a smooth, mathematically-defined surface that approximates the shape of the Earth but doesn't account for local variations in gravity or the Earth's surface (e.g., mountains or valleys).

    GPS devices natively measure ellipsoidal height because GPS satellites reference the Earth’s ellipsoid model.


    Orthometric Height (H):

    This is the height measured from the mean sea level (MSL), which is influenced by Earth’s gravity field. It accounts for the variations in gravity by using a more complex model called the geoid, which is a representation of global mean sea level across the Earth. The orthometric height is what people typically refer to as "elevation above sea level."
    The relationship between these two heights is determined by the geoid height (N):

    H = h - N



When I have a feature class where "coordinates have Z value" is checked, then host a feature layer and connect data using either  Field Maps or Collector, what is being recorded for the Z value? Is it altitude or elevation?

    When you enable Z-values for a feature class, and then collect data using either Field Maps or Collector with a GPS-enabled device, the Z-value that is recorded depends on the source of the location data and its configuration.

    By default:

        The Z-value (or elevation) recorded in the feature layer when collecting data is typically ellipsoidal height (altitude above the WGS 84 ellipsoid), as provided by the GPS device.

        GPS receivers, including most mobile devices, use WGS 84 to provide the location (latitude, longitude) and ellipsoidal height (which many GPS devices refer to as "altitude").

    To summarize:

        Field Maps or Collector will record the Z-value as altitude, which is the height above the reference ellipsoid (not necessarily sea level).
        To store elevation (height above mean sea level), you would need to apply a geoid model (e.g., EGM96) to convert the ellipsoidal height to orthometric height. Most smartphones and GPS receivers do not automatically apply this conversion unless configured to do so.
        If you are using an external GPS device (like a Bad Elf GPS), you might be able to configure it to use a geoid model for accurate elevations above sea level, but this is typically not the default.









Elevation refers to the height of a point on Earth's surface above mean sea level.
    
Altitude is the vertical distance of a point or object above a reference level
