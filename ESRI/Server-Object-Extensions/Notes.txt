Automate the debugging of SOEs

    UPDATE THE SOE
        Another call references the uploaded .soe through the itemID and updates the extension.

        http://localhost/arcgis/admin/services/types/extensions/update

    RESTART SERVICES
        After the SOE is updated, all services that use it are stopped and must be restarted. This can also be accomplished through REST calls:

        http://localhost/arcgis/admin/services/[service_folder]/[service_name]/start

    These calls are all pretty straightford to automate in a Python script using the requests library (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).

    Update SOI:
        http://server:port/arcgis/admin/services/[<folder>]/<serviceName.serviceType>/edit(POST only)
