Requirements for SOEs:

    Dev Requirements
        - Visual Studio 2013
        - Latest ArcObjects SDK for .NET (currently 10.5.1)
        - Authorization/installation of ArcGIS Server, Engine, or Desktop

    Deployment Requirements
        - ArcGIS Server 10.5.1


    ArcObjects SDK:
        my.esri.com > My Organizations > Downloads > Products > All Versions tab > ArcGIS Desktop 10.5.1 (select your version) > View Downloads > ctrl + f for ArcObjects SDK
    
        NOTE: for ArcOBJECTS SDK for .NET 10.5.1 you need Visual Studio Community 2015
        Download the ISO from Microsoft, the installer will be in the ISO

Attach to process:
    In ArcGIS Server Manager:
        Site > Extensions > Debug Settings > check 'Enable debugging of extensions'

    Open Task Manager > Right-click on column > check 'command line' > find the service > right-click the service > go to details > find the PID

    In Visual Studio Code:
        (run as administrator) > menu > Attach to Process (check show processes from all users) > attach to the PID

    then set a breakpoint and run a query through the service



    Note: Sometimes, you might see two processes with the same command line... try stopping / starting that service individually / manually in ArcGIS Server Manager. Then sort by command line in Task Manager to see if it fixed it. If there are two processes with the same command line but not the same PID, sometimes the breakpoint may not be triggered...




Automate the debugging of SOEs
    http://joshwerts.com/blog/2015/04/12/debugging-server-object-extensions-soe-in-style/

    UPDATE THE SOE
        Another call references the uploaded .soe through the itemID and updates the extension.

        http://localhost/arcgis/admin/services/types/extensions/update

    RESTART SERVICES
        After the SOE is updated, all services that use it are stopped and must be restarted. This can also be accomplished through REST calls:

        http://localhost/arcgis/admin/services/[service_folder]/[service_name]/start

    These calls are all pretty straightford to automate in a Python script using the requests library (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).

    Github example:

    Update SOI:
        http://server:port/arcgis/admin/services/[<folder>]/<serviceName.serviceType>/edit(POST only)

    yes and in interceptorOrderList you put the order of chain if you have a chain
    see your json definition of service ../admin/services//FOLDER/SERVICE_NAME.MapServer?f=pjson
