    when using .../arcgis/tokens/generateToken
        'client': 'requestip'

    if you use requestip, the ArcGIS Server will generate a token but that token will only be valid for the ip address of the machine that requested the token initially.

    If you are running a script and try to print ip address using:
        ip_addr = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
    and see consistent ip address
    using token for multiple calls still may result in invalid token error because the above only prints the local ip address, whereas the ArcGIS Server looks at the public ip address of the machine requesting a token.

    If static public ip addresses are not an option, use these parameters when calling generateTokoen:

        'client': 'referer',
        'referer': 'https://some.domain.com',

    and make sure that any requests that use the resulting token also include the same referer as the initial token request in the header:

        headers = {
            'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
            'Referer': 'https://dev1.atlas.driscolls.com'
        }

    see referer_update_sample.py and requestip_update_sample.py


Generally you can only create or edit data through a FeatureServer URL:
    https://domain.com/arcgis/rest/services/ORACLE/MASTER_GROWER/FeatureServer/0/updateFeatures

    the following is invalid:
    https://domain.com/arcgis/rest/services/ORACLE/MASTER_GROWER/MapServer/0/updateFeatures


https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-rest-apis-and-services-questions/how-to-post-update-to-a-feature-where-it-has-a/m-p/1522843

    apparently you can use calculate to update features based on a where clause without knowing the objectids

    ArcGIS Rest Request are hosted here

Authentication:

    https://[ENTER_HOSTNAME_HERE]/server/rest/services

    Basically, go to the REST service URL for the server... (typically, this has the various service directories)

    Open this URL in a web browser. At the top right, you will see a link for "Get Token" which will be the URL for getting tokens. The URL will be something like:
        https://[ENTER_HOSTNAME_HERE]/server/tokens/
