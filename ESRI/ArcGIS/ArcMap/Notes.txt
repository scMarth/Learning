To select multiple layers with the mouse, you can use the Select Features mode then hold shift as you box-click the features that you want to select.

To color polygons by value:

    Right-click layer in Table of Contents > Symbology tab > Quantities > Value (select the field you want to use) > right-click in color table > reverse sorting

Export layer data (feature class) as shapefile:
    right click > Data > Export Data... > (remember to save as shapefile in the dropdown before you save)

Share a layer as a service:
    Add desired layer to map > File > Share as > Service > 

Start / stop a service:

        In the Catalog tree, expand the GIS Servers node.

        Double-click Add ArcGIS Server and click Administer GIS server to establish an administrative connection to the server. If you have this connection set up, you can skip this step. For instructions on how to connect, see Connect to ArcGIS Server from ArcGIS Desktop.

        Within your connection to ArcGIS Server, right-click your service to reveal a menu for starting and stopping the service. Alternatively, you can display the ArcGIS Server Tools toolbar that contains these same operations.

    e.g. click to expand agsadmin on domain (admin) > navigate to service > right-click > stop

Project to different coordinate system:
    In right pane, at the bottom, click 'search' tab > Search 'Project' > Project (Data Management) (Tool) >

Troubleshooting:

    If you can't delete a .gdbtable inside a file geodatabase e.g. :
    
        PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: '//vgisdata/gis data/GIS_Projects/Qscend/request_data/\\QScendRequestData.gdb\\a00000009.gdbtable'

    This might be because the ArcGIS REST Service is using that file in the geodatabase. You have to stop the service. See above for stopping the service.

https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/administer/windows/configure-service-instance-settings.htm

    If you set maximum number of instances per machine under 'pooling' for a service to 2, it seems like 2 processes can access the service at a given time.

Printing from scripts:
    http://obidangis.blogspot.com/2013/06/how-to-print-messages-regardless-of.html

    This thread  allows you to print a message from a standalone script or from run within ArcMap/ArcToolbox.  It simply collects the appends information to a list and either "print" ' s or uses the arcpy.AddMessage method.  Simple and can be called from any Python program.  Requires a list of messages
