ChatGPT on no selection for a feature layer when running a geoprocessing script with a Feature Set input:
    When using Feature Set as an input parameter in a geoprocessing script in ArcGIS Pro, the entire feature class will be passed to the script if no features are selected. This can make it difficult to determine whether the user intended to pass all features or if they simply did not make a selection.

If you are having issues with the syntax error in running a geoprocessing script in ArcGIS Pro, it may be worth trying to paste the code to a python formatter:
    https://codebeautify.org/python-formatter-beautifier

    this may find the location of the error if ArcGIS Pro is not indicating the right place where the code issue is

Catalog > Favorites > Add Item > Server > New ArcGIS Server
    server url: enter rest services directory URL



If you are not logged into ArcGIS Pro, you won't be able to run arcpy functions with the python that is coming with ArcGIS Pro it seems....
    even if you sign-in using a different account from the local account on the computer, it seems like it works

Share > Publish Web Layer >
    this will publish a hosted feature layer on AGOL if you are logged into an ArcGIS Online account

Publishing Map Services from ArcGIS Pro
    Share > web layer > offline service definition

    # Insert tab > Connections > server > New ArcGIS Server
    #     https://localhost:6443/arcgis
    #         (same URL as ArcGIS Server manager)
    
    # Catalog pane > Project > Servers > right-click ArcGIS Server connection > publish > map service

Republishing Map Services from ArcGIS Pro
    open catalog pane > in "Project" tab, right-click blank space > new > new server > New ArcGIS Server > for server URL, use the same URL as ArcGIS Server Manager e.g. https://localhost:6443/arcgis > enter username and password > leave everything else as default and press ok

    in server folder in same project tab in catalog pane > right-click the new server connection and verify that connection type is publisher > find the service you want to overwrite within the server connection and right-click > overwrite > select "Maps" within Project, select "Layers" or whatever the name of the Map is > press OK

    if you save the .aprx, the server connection will remain

for some reason, you can use Display Field: SHAPE.STLength() when you publish from a service definition, but not when republishing / overwriting on the same service from the same aprx file

Issue when trying to use:
aprx = arcpy.mp.ArcGISProject(aprx_path) we get OSError on the path even if the path is verified as a valid file path:

    aprx_path = os.environ["APRX_PATH"]
    arcpy.AddMessage('APRX_PATH: {}'.format(aprx_path))
    if os.path.exists(aprx_path):
        arcpy.AddMessage('aprx_path exists')
    else:
        arcpy.AddMessage('aprx_path DNE')


    # debugging
    import socket, getpass

    hostname = socket.gethostname()
    ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)
    arcpy.AddMessage("Hostname: {}".format(hostname))
    arcpy.AddMessage("IP Address: {}".format(ip_address))
    arcpy.AddMessage('aprx_path: {}'.format(aprx_path))
    username = getpass.getuser()
    arcpy.AddMessage("Current user: {}".format(username))


    aprx = arcpy.mp.ArcGISProject(aprx_path)

note that if you don't use the environment variable and have a hard-coded path in the geoprocessing script, the published service will have that path changed, and you will most likely get different errors since the changed path will probably not exist...

also if the geoprocessing script works when run manually from ArcGIS Pro but doesn't run as a geoprocessing service, I have noticed that the user that is running the script is different in this scenario..

    https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-enterprise-questions/gp-service-retain-absolute-file-path/td-p/234023
    "Unfortunately, the publishing process and GP framework expect everything to be in a jobs directory. You'll need to update the published script or set up a new jobs directory as workarounds."

    environment variables seem to unchanged


    go to the folder that contains the .aprx file > right-click > properties > security > edit > add > type in 'arcgis' > check names > name not found should pop up > locations > select T-ATL-WEB-A1-02 > ok > ok > it should have found T-ATL-WEB-A1-02\arcgis > ok > allow full control > ok
        still fails...

Working with .aprx files with geoprocessing services:
    there is a known bug with using aprx.save() in ArcGIS Pro:

        https://support.esri.com/en-us/bug/an-oserror-message-is-returned-when-using-the-arcgis-pr-bug-000145915

    it seems like re-starting the EC2 server instance fixed the issue and I was able to run the GP script after opening Pro after the re-start. However, re-running the script and I was seeing the same issue again.

    close pro then re-open pro
    runs first time after opening pro
    fails if you run second time in the same pro session apparently

    the above testing is after calling
        del aprx
    which doesn't seem to resolve the issue

    https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/mapping/arcgisproject-class.htm
        apparently if the Pro project has been accessed by another script, the Project gets put in read-only mode which makes it so that you can't use .save()
    
    aprx.saveACopy(aprx_path) and overwriting on the same file seems to work as a work-around


Import a .mxd file:
    under the insert tab, click import map



Sharing a geoprocessing service:
    If you are not using portal, then when you right-click a geoprocessing task in the geoprocessing history pane > share as, share web tool will be greyed out if you are using a stand-alone server.

    Right-click in history > share as > save as offline service definition > geoprocessing service on standalone server

    To publish, you must save as offline-service definition, then in ArcGIS Server Manager, go to services > "Publish Service" > publish from the service definition.

    If you want to overwrite on the service with the same name, right-click the ArcGIS Server Manager tab in chrome > duplicate tab > then delete the old service before publishing again.




Create a shapefile:
    right click layer in contents pane on the left > data > export features >
        output feature class: select folder outside out .gdb and name it *.shp

Adding rest service url / fc path
    Add Data > Data from Path > paste path.
        e.g. 'M:\...\request_data\request.gdb'
        or 'https://webserver.com/path/MapServer/0'

Connect to SDE:
    In 'Catalog' tab on the right pane:

    right-click 'Databases' > New Database Connection > 
        e.g. Database Platform = SQL Server etc.

Create a CSV:
    In 'Catalog' tab on the right pane:

    Type 'table to excel' in the search bar > click 'Table to Excel' > Select FC for Input Table, select output > Run

    This generates an .xlsx > You have to open it excel, there may be some errors, just try to inspect the Excel file > Save it as a .csv

Query:
