If you have a geoprocessing service item added in AGOL, in web app builder if you add that item as a widget in Web App Builder, it used to send all the attributes along with the submitJob event.

However, in Experience Builder, if you add said item as a geoprocessing task in the Analysis tool, it doesn't send every attribute, it only sends the OBJECTID.

Therefore, if you use a geoprocessing service that would work in Web App Builder, you may see the error in Experience Builder:
    RuntimeError: A column was specified that does not exist
