Notes for ArcGIS Online Webmap templates:
    https://developers.arcgis.com/web-map-specification/objects/featureLayer/

    "capabilities": "Query,Editing",
    "capabilities": "Query,Edit",
        doesn't actually allow editing....


    "capabilities": "Query,Update",
    "opacity": 1,
    "layerType": "ArcGISFeatureLayer",
    "layerDefinition": {
        "capabilities": "Query,Update"
    },

        this seems to only allow editing of this layer however it also removes the copy option...


    "capabilities": "Query,Update,Editing,Sync",
    "layerDefinition": {
        "capabilities": "Query,Update,Editing,Sync"
    },
    "title": "RANCHES"
        seems to work for only allowing editing on a layer for offline maps


    list of values not documented anywhere, however according to ChatGPT, they are:

        Query: Allows the layer to be queried for features and attributes.

        Create: Allows the addition of new features or records.

        Update: Allows the modification or updating of existing features or records.

        Delete: Allows the deletion of features or records.

        Editing: Indicates that the layer supports editing capabilities, encompassing creating, updating, and deleting features.

        Sync: Allows synchronization of offline edits made to the layer when the web map is used in a mobile or disconnected environment.



If you are unable to share an item in AGOL with a certain group (the group is not available to be selected when you try to share it with groups) it can be due to ownership.

    If the item was created by a certain user, but the AGOL group is owned by a different user, then you need to add the user that owns the AGOL item to the group (use the account of the user that owns the group), then from the other user that owns the AGOL item, add that item to the group.

Hosting images with ArcGIS Online:
    https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/adding-and-using-photos-and-images/

    From Content tab > add item > from my computer > select the image > share with everyone > copy the URL

    you can use these URLs for Web Mapping Application Widget Icons in the data JSON icon URL

    you can download images uploaded in Web Mapping Applications for geoprocessing widgets (read Web Mapping Application Widget Icons) and then re-upload them to AGOL

    you can generalize the URL based on itemids as well:
        https://youragoldomain.com/sharing/rest/content/items/{}/data'.format(agol_item.itemid)

Web Mapping Application Widget Icons:

    when you create a Web App Builder and add a widget and create an icon for that widget, it gets stored to AGOL with the url in the form of:

        https://agolurl.com/sharing/rest/content/items/${itemId}/resources/inConfig/8439956997463236.png
    
    if you inspect element for the WAB:

        https://agolurl.com/sharing/rest/content/items/2a8ac6c0698a42b9a8dba96898848a72/resources/inConfig/8439956997463236.png?token=TOKEN

    (see request_token_from_agol.py on how to create a token)


Unexpected token '<'
    
    If you try to select too many features as input to a geoprocessing widget in Web App Builder web mapping application, you will get this error. Checking the network traffic and comparing the submitJob POST request and comparing it to a successful submitJob where less features are selected, you will notice that it doesn't have any features in the POST payload. If you check the error logs in the ArcGIS Server where the geoprocessing service is hosted in ArcGIS Server Manager, it appears as if nothing is selected, as you will see:
        ERROR 000735: Selection: Value is required ERROR 000735: Selection: Value is required

    Testing on selection size for inputs to Geoprocessing Widgets:

        success:
            2555 (number of records selected)
            2657
            2699
            2705
            2724
            2747
            2756
            2862

        Unexpected token '<'
            2760 (number of records selected)
            2764
            2768
            2770
            2815
            2957
            3001
            3541
            3382
            3744
            4099
            4035
            3982
        
        It seems like somewhere past about 2700 records the AGOL runs into errors creating the request to the service.
        I am assuming it will vary based on length of OBJECTIDs... from ArcGIS server point of view, it seems as if there is nothing selected. So it seems like the issue is to do with AGOL side only... there isn't much documentation on the web app builder limitations however.

If you are trying to add a Geoprocessing Script as an item and can't get the popup to embed credentials, try this:
    https://domain.com/server/rest/services/GP/DeleteApplicationBlocks/GPServer
    instead of
    https://domain.com/server/rest/services/GP/DeleteApplicationBlocks/GPServer/Delete%20Selected%20Blocks




Add FS layers (all) as AGOL item > creates Feature Layer
Add MS layer (all) as AGOL item > creates Map Image Layer





Hosting a feature service:
    create a shapefile > login to AGOL > content (top left menu) > add item > select the shapefile

Allowing feature service to be modified publicly:
    login to AGOL > content > select service > settings > enable editing
                                               overview > share > everyone (public)

Republish a service (after schema change):
    Open the mxd (service map for publishing) > sign in (use your Esri login) >
    File > share as > service > overwrite an existing service > login (this login is different from the Esri login... it should be your Windows login) > choose the same service you're overwriting > analyze then publish (it should save the previous settings)


Having a null value-selectable in a drop-down for a geoprocessing service:
    Seems like this isn't possibe?
