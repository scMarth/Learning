Unexpected token '<'
    
    If you try to select too many features as input to a geoprocessing widget in Web App Builder web mapping application, you will get this error. Checking the network traffic and comparing the submitJob POST request and comparing it to a successful submitJob where less features are selected, you will notice that it doesn't have any features in the POST payload. If you check the error logs in the ArcGIS Server where the geoprocessing service is hosted in ArcGIS Server Manager, it appears as if nothing is selected, as you will see:
        RROR 000735: Selection: Value is required ERROR 000735: Selection: Value is required


If you are trying to add a Geoprocessing Script as an item and can't get the popup to embed credentials, try this:
    https://domain.com/server/rest/services/GP/DeleteApplicationBlocks/GPServer
    instead of
    https://domain.com/server/rest/services/GP/DeleteApplicationBlocks/GPServer/Delete%20Selected%20Blocks




Add FS layers (all) as AGOL item > creates Feature Layer
Add MS layer (all) as AGOL item > creates Map Image Layer





Hosting a feature service:
    create a shapefile > login to AGOL > content (top left menu) > add item > select the shapefile

Allowing feature service to be modified publicly:
    login to AGOL > content > select service > settings > enable editing
                                               overview > share > everyone (public)

Republish a service (after schema change):
    Open the mxd (service map for publishing) > sign in (use your Esri login) >
    File > share as > service > overwrite an existing service > login (this login is different from the Esri login... it should be your Windows login) > choose the same service you're overwriting > analyze then publish (it should save the previous settings)


Having a null value-selectable in a drop-down for a geoprocessing service:
    Seems like this isn't possibe?
