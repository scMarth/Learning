installation documentation: https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/guide/install-guide/

samples need to be copied into the client directory

arcgis-experience-builder-1.16 - getting 0x80010135 path too long when trying to extract
    same for 1.15

    renamed zip to expb1.16 and it worked

    using 1.16 with samples: https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources (v1.16)

    cd client
    git clone https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources sdk-sample

    npm ci
        (run on both client and server)

    npm start
        (run on both client and server)

    migrating from  Web AppBuilder: https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/guide/migrating-from-web-appbuilder/

        "ArcGIS Experience Builder is different from Web AppBuilder in a variety of ways. Because of these differences, directly converting custom widgets and themes from Web AppBuilder to Experience Builder is not possible. Even though it is a manual process, here are some tips, techniques, and recommended practices to consider as you are re-building your widget or theme for Experience Builder."

"CORS is a security feature in web browsers that blocks requests made to a domain different from the one serving the web app (cross-origin requests) unless the server allows it."







Migrating to Experience Builder Developer Edition from Web App Builder Developer Edition:
- in Web App Builder Developer Edition, Dojo (a JavaScript framework commonly used for building web large, enterprise-level applications) was heavily used
- Experience Builder Developer Edition does not use Dojo, instead, it is built on React, TypeScript, Webpack, and ArcGIS API for JavaScript (4.x)
