sample code:

https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/sample-code/

installation documentation: https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/guide/install-guide/

samples need to be copied into the client directory

arcgis-experience-builder-1.16 - getting 0x80010135 path too long when trying to extract
    same for 1.15

    renamed zip to expb1.16 and it worked

    using 1.16 with samples: https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources (v1.16)

    cd client
    git clone https://github.com/esri/arcgis-experience-builder-sdk-resources sdk-sample

    npm ci
        (run on both client and server)

    npm start
        (run on both client and server)

    migrating from  Web AppBuilder: https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/guide/migrating-from-web-appbuilder/

        "ArcGIS Experience Builder is different from Web AppBuilder in a variety of ways. Because of these differences, directly converting custom widgets and themes from Web AppBuilder to Experience Builder is not possible. Even though it is a manual process, here are some tips, techniques, and recommended practices to consider as you are re-building your widget or theme for Experience Builder."

"CORS is a security feature in web browsers that blocks requests made to a domain different from the one serving the web app (cross-origin requests) unless the server allows it."







Migrating to Experience Builder Developer Edition from Web App Builder Developer Edition:
- in Web App Builder Developer Edition, Dojo (a JavaScript framework commonly used for building web large, enterprise-level applications) was heavily used
- Experience Builder Developer Edition does not use Dojo, instead, it is built on React, TypeScript, Webpack, and ArcGIS API for JavaScript (4.x)



Apparently in both WebAppBuilder DE (Developer Edition) and Experience Builder DE, IdentityManager is used to keep track of user logins and token authentication to services.
In WebAppBuilder DE, if you do:
    grep -ri 'identitymanager' *
you will see IdentityManager in the dist folder






When you download the Experience Builder Developer Edition (EB DE) from Esri, it typically includes the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript as part of its package. This means you should be able to use the SDK right away without needing to download or install anything additional.
