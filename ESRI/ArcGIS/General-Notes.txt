If you get the error:

    Profile storage space

    You have exceeded your profile storage space. Before you can log off, you need to move some items from your profile to network or local storage.

To find the files to delete, go to:

    Desktop > <username> > AppData (hidden)
        click the search box > in the top left menu, click the 'size' dropdown > start searching from largest files and work your way down

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\ESRI\Desktop10.4\ArcToolbox\History
    All files here can pretty much be safely deleted.


ArcSDE
    - software that enables ArcGIS applications to store, manage, and retrieve data in a RDBMS (relational database management system, such as Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.)
    - all ArcSDE related tables will also be prefixed with dbo.
    - ArcSDE is sometimes described as middleware, a layer of software that sits between Esri's ArcGIS products and RDBMS software and manages data exchanges between them.
    - In SQL Server, a Database Administrator (dbo) owns everything and has control over other databases residing in that instance of SQL Server.
    - In SQL Server, a Geodatabase Administrator is talking about the user who owns/manages the ArcSDE related tables within a database.  That can be a dbo user (Windows account) or a sde user (SQL Server account)
