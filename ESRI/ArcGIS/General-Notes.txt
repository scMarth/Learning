Database Triggers:
    It seems like you can't really detect when a particular field is updated. For example, if you tried to do something in a trigger like:

        IF (UPDATE(FIELD_NAME)) BEGIN
            ...
        END

    The IF statement would always be entered regardless of which field was modified because it seems like ArcGIS will just overwrite the entire row.

    Also, if you have archiving on a particular feature class and try to set a trigger on that table: if you add both a trigger on UPDATE and INSERT, both will be triggered when you make an update, because a new row is inserted into the feature class table (the archiving copy).



Popups in Explorer:
    If you create a web map from a MapServer URL and then view that web map in explorer, you won't get popups when you tap on a feature in Explorer. You would only get the popup if you use a FeatureServer URL.

Publish a table
    To publish a table, you may need to publish it with another service that has geospatial data. ArcMap will not let you publish a map with just a table.



Creating a table using another as a template in SQL Server Management Studio:
    Right-click a table > Script Table as > CREATE to > New Query Editor Window

    Change the table name, change fields as desired, then run the query. The new table should be created.

Adding a new feature class in an enterprise geodatabase.
    Create a shapefile in ArcCatalog (this will be the template to the feature class)

    In ArcMap, right-click the SDE connection and import the shapefile. The new feature class should be added to the enterprise geodatabase.

If you get the error:

    Profile storage space

    You have exceeded your profile storage space. Before you can log off, you need to move some items from your profile to network or local storage.

To find the files to delete, go to:

    Desktop > <username> > AppData (hidden)
        click the search box > in the top left menu, click the 'size' dropdown > start searching from largest files and work your way down

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\ESRI\Desktop10.4\ArcToolbox\History
    All files here can pretty much be safely deleted.


ArcSDE
    - software that enables ArcGIS applications to store, manage, and retrieve data in a RDBMS (relational database management system, such as Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.)
    - all ArcSDE related tables will also be prefixed with dbo.
    - ArcSDE is sometimes described as middleware, a layer of software that sits between Esri's ArcGIS products and RDBMS software and manages data exchanges between them.
    - In SQL Server, a Database Administrator (dbo) owns everything and has control over other databases residing in that instance of SQL Server.
    - In SQL Server, a Geodatabase Administrator is talking about the user who owns/manages the ArcSDE related tables within a database.  That can be a dbo user (Windows account) or a sde user (SQL Server account)
