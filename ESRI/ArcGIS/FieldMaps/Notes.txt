Using default values in Field Maps and feature services published from ArcGIS Pro is known to be buggy:

    https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-field-maps-questions/default-values-not-working-in-field-maps-mobile/td-p/1116905/page/4

        some things to try:

            In Pro: edit tab > manage templates > click on a layer > click properties > change default value to something different then change back to desired vaue > republish the service

                > in AGOL click on hosted feature layer > open in mapviewer > create a feature, usually this will show the correct default value, at which point if you check in Field Maps afterwards it may start working now.... maybe it is a network cache issue?

After doing some research, I found that there is a way to hide the blue plus button (add feature button) in ArcGIS Field Maps mobile app. We can do this by disabling the "Add" capability under the What kind of editing is allowed section in the feature layer's settings. Keeping the update and delete capabilities will allow the user to still update the features, but will remove the add features button. You can find more on this setting in this documentation.

If you add a new field to a feature class then you try collecting a feature in Field Maps and when you submit it you get the following error:

        Unable to submit
        Error performing apply edits operation

    Check the underlying feature class if it has a versioned view name. If it does, the error could be caused by forgetting to add the new field(s) to the versioned view after adding them to the core feature class.

If you got an error:

    SEVERE  Sep 30, 2022, 11:31:51 PM   Error performing apply edits operation Error handling service request :0x8004152a - Attribute column not found in 'esriDataSourcesGDB.SdeWorkspace.1'   Rest

    SEVERE  Sep 30, 2022, 11:31:51 PM   Instance of service 'SALTA/OPERATIONAL_RASP.MapServer' failed to process a request. AutomationException: Attribute column not found SALTA/OPERATIONAL_RASP.MapServer

    after adding a new field to a feature class, try checking the versioned view for that feature class, GDB_TO_DATE and GDB_FROM_DATE may have gotten removed from the view when the new field was added

If you create a map from Field Maps and two related layers but each layer is on a different service (published from two different .mxds), it seems like the relationship isn't reflected in Field Maps.


If you are seeing empty fields start with a space in Field Maps, check to make sure the following flag is set for the underlying service:

    ("setDefaultsToNullForNotNullFieldsInTemplates":"true")

                for ext in dataObj['extensions']:
                    if ext['typeName'] == 'FeatureServer':
                        print('Setting property "setDefaultsToNullForNotNullFieldsInTemplates" = "true"')
                        ext['properties']['setDefaultsToNullForNotNullFieldsInTemplates'] = 'true'

    Smart Forms available as part of the ArcGIS system in multiple platforms and products
        ArcGIS Field Maps
        Map Viewer
        Web apps
        Desktop apps (future)

    Key capabilities of Smart forms
        - use groups to organize fields
        - apply conditional visibility to fields
        - format your form and its fields
        - qualify required and read-only fields
        - streamline entry using input types


    Open up field maps
        - click on a map created in Map Viewer (not Map Viewer classic)

    get user info for a calculated expression:

        var user = null;
        user = GetUser(Portal('https://portalurl.com'));
        Console(user);
        When(user != null, user.email, null)

    e.g.
        var parentId = $feature.PARENT_ID;
        Console(parentId);

        var where = `PARENT_ID = '${parentId}'`;
        var result = Filter($layer, where);
        Console(Count(result));

        for (var i in result){
            Console(i.OBJECTID);
        }

    e.g.
        // layer 6 is the producing area, current layer is the block
        var paLayer = FeatureSetById($datastore, 6);

        // see if current feature interescts with any producing areas
        var intersectResult = Intersects(paLayer, $feature)

            Console('PRODUCING_AREA_NAME', i.PRODUCING_AREA_NAME);

        // var ranchesLayer = FeatureSetById($datastore, 1); // causes error in mobile

        var paLayer = FeatureSetByName($map, 'PRODUCING AREAS'); // works in mobile
