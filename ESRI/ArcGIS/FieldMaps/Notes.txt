If you are seeing empty fields start with a space in Field Maps, check to make sure the following flag is set for the underlying service:

    ("setDefaultsToNullForNotNullFieldsInTemplates":"true")

                for ext in dataObj['extensions']:
                    if ext['typeName'] == 'FeatureServer':
                        print('Setting property "setDefaultsToNullForNotNullFieldsInTemplates" = "true"')
                        ext['properties']['setDefaultsToNullForNotNullFieldsInTemplates'] = 'true'
