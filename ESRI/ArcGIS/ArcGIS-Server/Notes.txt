If layers are partially loading but all services are up and running, try checking:
    - make sure that the C drive isn't running out of space
    - make sure that there are no background processes / scheduled tasks running. Especially if there is a scheduled task that has become unresponsive / still running that is trying to use services / generate tokens to authenticate REST requests
    - make sure that you have enough memory
    - if you are having memory issues, you might want to try restarting the ArcGIS servers

If layers are only partly loading in Field Maps for a Feature Service, try making sure that the port used to publish the service from is port 6443 instead of 6080:

    https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/install/windows/ports-used-by-arcgis-server.htm

        http port 6080 is no longer allowed, and only https port 6443 should be used

        you can check that 6080 is no longer allowed by going to:

            http://localhost:6080/arcgis/manager/

            which redirects to:

            https://localhost:6443/arcgis/manager/




If you are running out of space, try deleting some of the logs:
    deleted files in C:\arcgisserver\logs\IP_ADDREsS\server
        these files can get very large

    C:\arcgisserver\logs\IP_ADDRESS\services
        the logs in this folder can grow to take up a lot of space too
    

If you are getting Gateway Timeouts (504) for requests to the ArcGIS Server, one possible cause is that the server is running out of space in the default (C:/) drive. You can try to restart the server by using command:
    shutdown -r
in the command prompt if there are things that are getting stored in virtual memory.

An error was encountered while synchronizing the config store. Failed to synchronize machine '10.184.14.70' with the site. ArcGIS Server Site is currently being configured by another administrative operation. Please try again later.

    Try restarting all machines in the cluster as well as the file server

    Open connections if they are getting rejected connections via 6443 port

For troubleshooting, you can look at logs in:
    C:\arcgisserver\logs\10.184.XX.XX\server

Also in: C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server\framework\etc\service\logs

    This is the same location as ArcGIS Server executable. You can find it by right-clicking ArcGIS Server in services > properties > path to executable

If for some reason you can't access the rest directory from the primary instance in a cluster from localhost url, and you are seeing HTTP Error 504 Service Unavailable when you try to access from the browser, try restarting all instances in the cluster with 'shutdown -r' in command prompt, restart the primary instance last.
