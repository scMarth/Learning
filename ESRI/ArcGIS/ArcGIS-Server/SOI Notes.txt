If you try to start a service but it won't start because a server is occupied, some things you can try:
   - restart ArcGIS Server on all instances it is running on
   - if you ran a process that has makes changes to services, try closing the terminal that you are calling the process from, then restarting ArcGIS Server


SOI = Server Object Interceptor

HandleRESTRequest is invoked when a REST request is submitted

IRESTRequestHandler restRequestHandler = this.restSOIHelper.FindRequestHandlerDelegate<IRESTRequestHandler>();

restRequestHandler is the server object that is going to process the request. By calling:

   return restRequestHandler.HandleRESTRequest...

we submit the request to the server object. The function restRequestHandler.HandleRESTRequest sends our request to the server object and returns the result from the server object. The outer function HandleRESTRequest in turn returns this.

    The REST request sent to a map service carries lots of information, including request headers, output format, request parameters, operation name, and other service information. Request headers are returned by requestProperties. The output format is returned by outputFormat, which can be JSON, GeoJSON, image, and so on, depending on the specific operation. Request parameters are passed in as operationInput. The capabilities, resourceName, and operationName variables are usually used to locate the specific service operation to intercept.

HandleRESTRequest parameters
   operationName
      possibly values:
         "EXPORT"
         "QUERY"
         "QUERYRELATEDRECORDS"
         "CREATEREPLICA"
         "SYNCHRONIZEREPLICA"
         "ADDFEATURES"
         "UPDATEFEATURES"
         "DELETEFEATURES"
         "APPLYEDITS"

To build SOIs, you need ArcObjects SDK, which requires ArcGIS Desktop.
