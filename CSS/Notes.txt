Aligning two divs of width 50% side by side
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18262300/two-inline-block-elements-each-50-wide-do-not-fit-side-by-side-in-a-single-ro
    
    <div>
        <div class="half"></div>
        <div class="half"></div>
    </div>

        If div.half is given a style of "display: inline-block;", then they will appear
        to be 50% widths, but won't be side by side on the same line. This is because inline-block elements have whitespace between them (the \n character in this case).
