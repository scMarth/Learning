document.cookie = "age=" + name + " The quick brown fox ; jumps over the lazy dog";

This will create a cookie for the variable "age". The value is from the '=' until the ';'
Anything after the ';' is ignored / truncated it seems.

Thus, it seems that if you want to add more fields/parameter, you must create a separate cookie for a separate field/parameter.

e.g.

document.cookie = "age=25; name=Tiffany" will not work

it must be done with separate calls:

document.cookie = "age=25";
document.cookie = "name=Tiffany";

Note: it seems that ';' is optional

Cookies are usually deleted when a browser is closed or after a certain expiration date.




Github cookies:

console.log(document.cookie) prints out:
    _ga = ... ;
    _octo = ... ;
    has_recent_activity = ... ;
    tz = ... ;
    _gat = ... ;

Missing from above: (all are HTTP and Secure)
    _Host-user_session_same_site
    _gh_sess
    dotcom_user
    logged_in
    user_session

wikipedia:

A secure cookie can only be transmitted over an encrypted connection (i.e. HTTPS). A cookie is made secure by adding the Secure flag to the cookie.

    document.cookie = "username=John Doe; secure";

A http-only cookie cannot be accessed by client-side APIs, such as JavaScript. This restriction eliminates the thread of cookie theft via cross-site scripting XSS. However, the cookie remains vulnerable to cross-site tracing (XST) and cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks. A cookie is given this characteristic by adding the HttpOnly flag to the cookie.

    Note: A HttpOnly cookie means that it's not available to JavaScript. So there's no way to get/set the HttpOnly attribute of a cookie, because it would defeat the purpose of HttpOnly
