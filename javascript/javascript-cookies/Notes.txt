document.cookie = "age=" + name + " The quick brown fox ; jumps over the lazy dog";

This will create a cookie for the variable "age". The value is from the '=' until the ';'
Anything after the ';' is ignored / truncated it seems.

Thus, it seems that if you want to add more fields/parameter, you must create a separate cookie for a separate field/parameter.

e.g.

document.cookie = "age=25; name=Tiffany" will not work

it must be done with separate calls:

document.cookie = "age=25";
document.cookie = "name=Tiffany";

Note: it seems that ';' is optional
