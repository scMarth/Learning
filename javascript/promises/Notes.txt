Callback makes sense for this idea of an 'event':
    - when the mouse is pressed, trigger this function, it's an event

If you want to sequence asyncronous things that happen in the program, callbacks can get really unyieldly


function setup(){
    
    loadJSON(param, function(data){
        do something
        loadJSON(param, function(data){
            do something
            someOtherFunction(params, function(data){

            })
        })
    })
}

not sustainable because code keeps getting indented, hard to change




A promise is an Object

loadJSON(url, callback);
