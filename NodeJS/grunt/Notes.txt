Grunt is a build system. A build system does things like:
   - repetative tasks
      - concatenating JavaScript
         - if you have lots of js imports in a html file, the client has to make all those requests to your server. It's much more efficient to just return 1 file where they're all just concatenated back-to-back.
      - prefixing css
         - border-radius, -moz-border-radius, etc...
   -utulities
      - jshint - a build system will run jshint so that you can see errors as you write your js code
      - uglify - (compress / minify) js (reduce filesize) and css files
   -local server (for testing)
   -live reload - automatically refresh browser when you save a file

Build systems:
   Grunt (most popular)
   GULP
   BRUNCH

Why is it good?
   page speed
      - less file requests per load
      - faster file requests

   development workflow
      - you can use cool technologies like SASS

      - you can break your code into multiple files
      - easier to avoid code conflicts
      - you can avoid annoying, repetitive tasks



Run:

   sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

(grunt command line interface)

   npm init

change the name of the project in package.json

   npm install -S grunt

   touch Gruntfile.js

When you run grunt, it's going to load the Gruntfile

   grunt

Will just run whatever is in the 'default' task
