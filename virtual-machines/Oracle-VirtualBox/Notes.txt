Installing Fedora 31
    - 4096 MB (4GB) for the memory size
    - keep using defaults
    - virtual hard disk size - 60 GB
    - 4 CPUs
    - install Fedora to disk as normal
    - when it finished installing to the disk and it tells you to restart, just power off
    - change the boot order (put the hard disk first)
    - set up login information
    - sudo dnf update
    - sudo dnf upgrade
    - sudo dnf install dkms ? not sure if this is necessary
    - for fullscreen, you need to install VirtualBox Guest Additions (the .iso file comes with the installation of VirtualBox)
        - C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxGuestAdditions.iso
    - turn off the machine
    - settings > storage > add optical drive next to controller:ide > select VBoxGuestAdditions.iso
    - boot up virtual machine
    - open nautilus file explorer
    - click the vbox_ga drive > open terminal here
        - sudo dnf install kernel-headers kernel-devel make (not sure if this is ncessary)
        - sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
    - reboot, it should be fullscreen
