Chrome Bookmarks are stored:
    C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default

    there should be two files: Bookmarks, Bookmarks.bak

    to restore from the backup:
    
    1.) close Chrome
    2.) copy the contents of Bookmarks.bak into Bookmarks
    3.) re-launch Chrome

    if it is not working, check that the json in Bookmarks.bak is valid
