It seems that you need to be using X11 for screen recording to work on Linux.
To tell if you're using X11 or wayland:

$ echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
wayland

Wayland is enabled by default in the GNOME Desktop.

There aren't any good compatible screen recording programs for Wayland,
most require x11 to work.

Gnome does have a built in screen recorder... you can start / stop it with:
   alt+shift+ctrl+r

By default, it saves things in Home/Videos

It's well hidden, there's no app launcher for it, no menu entry to it, no quick button to turn it on or off, recording automatically stops after 30 seconds, 

You can increase the duration of screencasts manually:

   gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys max-screencast-length 0

0 for unlimited, 60 for 60 seconds, etc.

There's no export or encoding control, no option for audio recording, and the tool can only be used to record the desktop in whole, not a specific window, desktop or monitor.
