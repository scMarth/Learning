Graph-theoretic Models
    undirected
    directed graph = digraph
    weighted or unweighted

    a special kind of directed graph is a tree
    tree: any pair of nodes, if they are connected, are connected by a single path. There are no loops.

    applications:
        transporting information through a network
        transportation
        financial networks (moving money around)
        traditional networks (sewer, water, etc.) flows... maximization.
        social networks
    

waze uses graph theory
    intersections are vertices
    directed edges are roads
    weights are probably expected travel time for that road
