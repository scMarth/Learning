How to:

start at 22:02

log into arcgis online

requires 10.6 portals or later

webmap item page > create web app > operations dashboard

from a webmap: share > create a web app

hit the + sign to add things:
    you can hit 'list' and you can add a data source from a map or feature service

    for numbers: + add indicator

you can stack dashboard elements on top of each other to save space, just drag one on top of the other, drag it onto the center box, then you can tab between the elements

dashboards can be configured so that the widgets update based on the extent

source elements -> affect target elements

change based on map extent:
on an item (in this case, the map), in the upper-left hand corner, click configure > map actions > add action filter > add target > select an indicator, for example > 

for list:
configure > actions > when selection changes, add zoom to map

map extent can also change based on moving points on a record? (because sometimes the thing you're trying to keep track of moves out of the extent)

mobile: some support, but not there yet

when you author a dashboard for use on phones, you author it for the mode in which you're going to be looking at it or the view
