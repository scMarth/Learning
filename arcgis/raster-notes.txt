    A raster consists of a matrix of cells organized into rows and columns where each cell contains a value representing information, such as temperature.

    The location of each cell is defined by the row or column where it is located within the raster matrix. Essentially, the matrix is represented by a Cartesian coordinate system, in which the rows of the matrix are parallel to the x-axis and the columns to the y-axis of the Cartesian plane. Row and column values begin with 0.
