In arcpy, for someGeometry1.distanceTo(someGeometry2) to work, the two geometries must have the same spatialReference.

To convert from one spatialReference to another, see:

https://community.esri.com/thread/158286

    import arcpy  
    inputSRS = 'Projected Coordinate Systems/National Grids/Europe/British National Grid' # Projected    
    outputSRS = 'Geographic Coordinate Systems/World/WGS 1984' # Geographic    
    trsOut = 'OSGB_1936_To_WGS_1984_Petroleum'    
    srIn = arcpy.SpatialReference(inputSRS)      
    srOut = arcpy.SpatialReference(outputSRS)    
    pt = arcpy.Point()  
    ptGeoms = []  
    pt.X = 210000    
    pt.Y = 310000    
    ptGeoms.append(arcpy.PointGeometry(pt,srIn ))  
    arcpy.CopyFeatures_management(ptGeoms, 'base')  
    arcpy.Project_management('base',trsOut, srOut)  

Alternatively, you can use:

    convertedGeoemtry = pointGeometry.projectAs(targetSpatialReference)

to convert to another spatial reference.
