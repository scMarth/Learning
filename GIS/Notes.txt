He is trying to project latitude / longitude coordinates into another spatial reference. He is getting errors.
    "Just to clarify.... longitude latitude comes in different datums, so the numbers themselves need a spatial reference defined (such as GCS WGS84 or GCS NAD83) to begin with.  You need a defined spatial reference before data can be projected to another spatial reference, whether the units are the same or different."
