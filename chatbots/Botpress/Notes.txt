    Notes on how to embed on a website, or share it as a standalone application

A chatbot with 'smalltalk' template will respond to:

    In Q&A section:
        - you are annoying
        - stop talking
        - please stop it
        - you annoy me
        - you are unpleasant
        - you suck
        - you are a bad bot
        - you are useless
        - you are dumb
        - dumb bot
        - you are lame
        - you're horrible
        - What a waste of time you are!

    Fails:

        - you are irksome
        - you annoy me
        - you are quite irritating if i do say so myself
        - you are quite bothersome if i do say so myself
        - you are quite annoying
        - you are quite annoying if i do say so myself

    By default, it seems like this template will simply not respond if it doesn't find a good match.

    This template just has one flow, with no loop back to a node. It ends on the second flow node.

It seems extremely limited..

According to https://botpress.io/docs/main/dialog/#flows:
    A node generally transitions to another node or flow. When it doesn't, the conversation is ended. The next message from the user will then be part of an entirely new session.

    So it seems that to have a looped Q&A session, you can simply just have a flow start off by processing a question, and then have it end by giving a response. It looks like a new session would be started automatically when that flow terminates?
