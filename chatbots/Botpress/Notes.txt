    Notes on how to embed on a website, or share it as a standalone application

A chatbot with 'smalltalk' template will respond to:

    In Q&A section:
        - you are annoying
        - stop talking
        - please stop it
        - you annoy me
        - you are unpleasant
        - you suck
        - you are a bad bot
        - you are useless
        - you are dumb
        - dumb bot
        - you are lame
        - you're horrible
        - What a waste of time you are!

    Fails:

        - you are irksome
        - you annoy me
        - you are quite irritating if i do say so myself
        - you are quite bothersome if i do say so myself
        - you are quite annoying
        - you are quite annoying if i do say so myself

    By default, it seems like this template will simply not respond if it doesn't find a good match.

    This template just has one flow, with no loop back to a node. It ends on the second flow node.

It seems extremely limited..

According to https://botpress.io/docs/main/dialog/#flows:
    A node generally transitions to another node or flow. When it doesn't, the conversation is ended. The next message from the user will then be part of an entirely new session.

    So it seems that to have a looped Q&A session, you can simply just have a flow start off by processing a question, and then have it end by giving a response. It looks like a new session would be started automatically when that flow terminates?


creating a basic bot:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-5Pj2NsA3I

        Temp variables get reset when the flow gets to an end.

        To edit a node, go to the flows tab then double click on that node. From there, you can add transitions, and add what happens on enter.

        For on recieve, the user's input is stored in {{event.payload.text}}

        To navigate on the flow tab, click + hold and drag to pan.

        Following this example, it still won't understand when you say
            "I want to book a flight from London"
        but it does understand:
            "I want to book a flight to London"

Documentation seems limited, not a lot of examples.

Using a small-talk template:
    If you enter the same message, e.g. 'You're annoying' to a Q&A style bot, it seems like there's a timer on it sending the same response to the same question. For example, if you type 'You're annoying' 10 times quickly, you would only get 1 response back for those same messages. If you were to wait say a couple minutes between sending each 'You're annoying', it seems like it will respond to each one.

    Not sure what exactly the timeout is. It makes sense from an implementation standpoint since it would reduce server traffic and processing, however, it's probably burried deep in the implementation and I haven't seen it in the docs yet.

    Info on storing general purpose data.

{{event.nlu.intent.name}} NOTE: Curly brackets are not necessary when using code expressions

https://botpress.io/docs/main/nlu/
    Communication between users and bots are stored in the database, which means that sometimes personal informations (eg: credit card) may be persisted as well. To avoid that problem, it is possible to tell Botpress that certain entities are not to be persisted. When creating or editing an Entity, there is a small checkbox located in the upper right corner labeled sensitive.

    When checked, the information will still be displayed in the chat window, but the sensitive information will be replaced by ***** before being stored. The original value is still available from event.nlu.entities

    Language Server
    
        The language server provides additional informations about words, which allows your bot to understand words with a similar meaning even if you didn't specifically taught it about it. By default, your Botpress server will query one of our language server for that purpose. You can also choose to host your own server if you would like to keep everything on your premise. Head over to the Hosting page for more details.

Based on 'qna_info.json' in ./scrapwork/:

    what do you know about zoning? will give you info on 'community development'
    council regions? City of Salinas City Council District
    zoning info = no matches found
    zoning information = matches zoning fine
    council information, council info = City of Salinas City Council District
    budget info = no matches found
    budget = no matches found
    government = no matches found
    high performing government = community development
    city boundary = city boundary
    city boundaries = city limits

It seems like when you give it information to learn, it's kind of random as to whether or not it learns it well or not.

Note:

Originally, before I was importing the Q&A json file, I took the old json in:
    data/bots/gis-chatbot/qna
and then I put them in a folder called 'old' in the same directory. What happened was that when I looked at the Q&A section in the chatbot dashboard, I still saw those old Q&A items. When I tried to import the json that I had generated, I checked the checkbox to delete the old Q&A elements, but then I got an error saying something like Botpress qna delete error, no such file. However, when I refreshed I still saw the old Q&A items. So I tried deleting the 'old' directory that I stored the old Q&A json files in, and then I hit refresh, and doing this finally cleared the Q&A items in the dashboard.

After I cleared the old Q&A items, importing the generated json file worked.

    The instructions for hosting are very very vague. They are undirect and confusing, they aren't step by step, and they seem to mostly be for Linux.

Seems pretty iffy...
