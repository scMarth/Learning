Thinking of promises as "executing" is getting you confused. A promise is purely a notification mechanism. It is typically tied to some underlying asynchronous operation and when you create the promise, the asynchronous operation is typically started.

Promise.all() is then used to track when a whole bunch of asynchronous operations that you've already started have completed (or ended with an error).

So, you don't use Promise.all() to start a bunch of things. You use it just to track when they are all done and they are started elsewhere in your code.

When you manually create a promise with new Promise(), the promise executor is executed immediately. That's how they are designed.

If you had real asynchronous operations in your promise executor and you were doing console.log() when those operations completed, you'd probably not find any issue with how promises are designed. I think most of your confusion stems from the fact that you don't actually have any asynchronous operation inside your promise executor and thus there's really no reason to even use a promise for that. Promises are designed to track the completion of asynchronous operations. No reason to use them if you don't have an actual asynchronous operation.
