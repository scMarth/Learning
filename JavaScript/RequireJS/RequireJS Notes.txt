RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code.

   Until you call:
      require(['config'], function(){
         ...
      });

   config.js won't be loaded by the client because it is asynchronously loaded.

   Outside of the require, config.js may or may not be loaded. The function within the require statement is kind of a callback function. It fires when config is loaded.

   Define statement is for defining modules.

   A module is different from a traditional script file in that it defines a well-scoped object that avoids polluting the global namespace.
