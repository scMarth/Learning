JSX stands for JavaScript XML, it allows us to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. Although it looks similar to HTML, it follows XML syntax rules, which are stricter than HTML

Browsers only understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JSX is run through a compiler and converted into trandational html and javascript code.



const stateArray = useState(0); // Returns an array, e.g. [0, function]
const count = stateArray[0];    // First element is the state value
const setCount = stateArray[1]; // Second element is the state setter

   is equivalent to:

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);









const numbers = [10, 20, 30];

// Using destructuring to assign values from the array
const [first, second, third] = numbers;

console.log(first);  // 10
console.log(second); // 20
console.log(third);  // 30
