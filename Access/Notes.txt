7. Many To Many Relationships (Programming in Access 2013)

    5-Service Inc.accdb

Composite key:

    Contact_ID
    PhoneNumber_ID

    two ID fields together make a composite key (many to many relationship). It means that the same combination of one field and another field will happen more than once, and can thus be used to uniquely identify a record

VBA Modules?


It seems that when you create a form to view records, records are saved whenever you navigate away from that record to another record.

"Despite the (formerly) accepted answer to this question, the bang is not in fact a member or collection access operator. It does one simple and specific thing: The bang operator provides late-bound access to the default member of an object, by passing the literal name following the bang operator as a string argument to that default member.

That's it. The object doesn't have to be a collection. It doesn't have to have a method or property called Item. All it needs is a Property Get or Function which can accept a string as the first argument.

For much more detail and proof, see my blog post discussing this
