1. Introduction (Programming in Access 2013)


Access is a relational database system with rapid development.

Access is a way of maintaining your data.

Database

    Where does it go? (Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL, Access)

VBA = Visual Basic for Applications
    VBA6 has been discontinued by Microsoft

5. Organizing Our Data (Programming In Access 2013)

Foreign Key - Key from another table
Primary Key - main key for that table

7. Many To Many Relationships (Programming in Access 2013)

    5-Service Inc.accdb

Composite key:

    Contact_ID
    PhoneNumber_ID

    two ID fields together make a composite key (many to many relationship). It means that the same combination of one field and another field will happen more than once, and can thus be used to uniquely identify a record

VBA Modules?


It seems that when you create a form to view records, records are saved whenever you navigate away from that record to another record.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2923957/bang-notation-and-dot-notation-in-vba-and-ms-access

"Despite the (formerly) accepted answer to this question, the bang is not in fact a member or collection access operator. It does one simple and specific thing: The bang operator provides late-bound access to the default member of an object, by passing the literal name following the bang operator as a string argument to that default member.

That's it. The object doesn't have to be a collection. It doesn't have to have a method or property called Item. All it needs is a Property Get or Function which can accept a string as the first argument.

For much more detail and proof, see my blog post discussing this

If the menu for view code disappears:

click home click the pin button at the bottom right corner of the grey menu that shows up

Me.Undo vs Cancel = True

    Me.Undo = reset all changes to a form before the form is updated

    Cancel = True: 





Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus Access

When exporting to an ACCDE:

To disable a user from being able to see the code:

    File -> Options -> Current Database:

        Application Options -> Display Form (select which form you want to display when the user opens the ACCDE)

        Navigation -> uncheck Display Navigation Pne

        Ribbon and Toolbar Options ->

            uncheck Allow Full Menus
            uncheck Allow Default Shortcut Menus


Down arrow: (next to arrow left and arrow right in top left)

    More commands -> Current Database -> Ribbon and Toolbar Options

        Check Allow Default Shortcut Menus

Restart Access:

Right click on a tab -> Design View

    on the right sidebar (Property  Sheet): click on "On Load"

        click the triple dots to access the code

        in the sub:

            Private Sub Form_Open()

            ...


            ...

            End Sub

            add this line in the sub:

            ' Hide the top Ribbon menu
            DoCmd.ShowToolbar "Ribbon", acToolbarNo

Restart access:

you don't see the ribbon menu anymore



Application Options
    Display Form: frmProjectTracking

Navigation
    uncheck Display Navigation Pane

Ribbon and Toolbar Options
    uncheck Allow Full Menus
    check Allow Default Shortcut Menus

If a user really wanted to / knew how to, he could still enable code / navigation and potentially delete the database.


Seems like it's impossible to access design view from an ACCDE



Steps to completely locking an accde:

Open the ACCDB:

Top Left Arrow down -> more commands -> current database

    Navigation
        uncheck Display Navigation Pane

    Ribbon and Toolbar Options
        uncheck Allow Full Menus
        uncheck Allow Default Shortcut Menus

    Application Options
        Use Access Special Keys uncheck (disables F11 hotkey)

Right click tab -> design view:

    click 3 dots for onload:

    add these lines in the form_open sub

            ' Hide the top Ribbon menu
            DoCmd.ShowToolbar "Ribbon", acToolbarNo




File -> Save As

Make ACCDE

If you don't disable F11:

    THEY COULD STILL hit F11 to show the navigation pane
        in an accde:
            if they hit F11 then try to create a new record by manually typing it in in a table, they CAN

            but they cannot DELETE records (can't right click)

        in an accdb:
            same thing as above


        when new records are entered in manually, some checks are not performed. if a field has a dropdown in a form, for example, you can actually just type literally anything you want.

        on the other hand, some checks do seem to be performed: for example, in int fields, it only allows int values

        date fields are also enforced

        dropdowns can COMPLETELY be circumvented, though, same thing with phone numbers

        even records that have been locked can be modified from the table.......


bypass key: hold shift then double click ACCDB

shift + enter also works

you MUST keep holding the shift key until it fully loads

from there, even if you locked the accdb / accde, you can still undo the locks, re-enable the menus, etc.

When you use the bypass key:

    in an accde: you can't access the design view / code, but you can still access the tables with delete privaleges

    in an accdb: you can access the design view / code AND the tables
