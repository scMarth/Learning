primary colors = blue, red, yellow

secondary colors = purple, green, orange
    - created by mixing primaries

tertiary colors - created by mixing primaries and secondaries
    - red-orange
    - red-purple
    - blue-purple
    - blue-green
    - yellow-green
    - yellow orange

    As far as naming scheme goes, it looks like it is always primary color followed by the secondary color

hue - name of a color. e.g. red, blue, green, yellow, orange

saturation = intensity or purity of a hue
    high saturation - color looks really bright
    desaturation - color looks washed out or greyed out

value = degree of lightness or darkness of a hue

white          grey          black
light ------ midtones ------ dark

shade = a hue produced by adding black
tint = hue produced by adding white
tone = hue produced by adding grey

temperatures
    warm colors = reds, oranges, yellows
    cool colors = purples, blues, greens

monochromatic scheme = using one hue and adding white black or grey to create tints, tones, and shades
