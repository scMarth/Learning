    Leaflet only supports very fiew coordinate systems.

    Supported coordinate systems can be found here:
    https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.6.0.html#crs
        - check under 'Defined CRSs'

https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/projection/
    If we use a tileLayer and Mapbox, the coordinate reference system is by default EPSG:3857

It looks like OpenStreetMap is used by OpenDataSoft maps
