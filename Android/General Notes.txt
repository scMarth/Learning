If pairing an Android device with a car no longer plays music (no sound) even after assuring that volume for both the car and the phone volume levels aren't at 0, then you can try the following:
   unpair the phone from the car > unpair the car from the phone > power off the phone > wipe the cache partition > repair

   This may fix bluetooth audio getting messed up after software updates.
