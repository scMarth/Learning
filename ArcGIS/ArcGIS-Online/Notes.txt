Hosting a feature service:
    create a shapefile > login to AGOL > content (top left menu) > add item > select the shapefile

Allowing feature service to be modified publicly:
    login to AGOL > content > select service > settings > enable editing
                                               overview > share > everyone (public)

Republish a service (after schema change):
    Open the mxd (service map for publishing) > sign in >
    File > share as > service > overwrite an existing service > login > choose the same service you're overwriting > analyze then publish (it should save the previous settings)
