If you get the error:

    Profile storage space

    You have exceeded your profile storage space. Before you can log off, you need to move some items from your profile to network or local storage.

To find the files to delete, go to:

    Desktop > <username> > AppData (hidden)
        click the search box > in the top left menu, click the 'size' dropdown > start searching from largest files and work your way down

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\ESRI\Desktop10.4\ArcToolbox\History
    All files here can pretty much be safely deleted.
