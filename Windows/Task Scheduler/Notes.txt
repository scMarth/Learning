Setting up a scheduled task for running a python script with Windows Task Scheduler:

   Create Task > General > Give name, check 'Run whether user is logged in or not'

   Triggers > add a date trigger

   Actions Start a program:
      - Program/script: C:\Python27\ArcGISx6410.4\python.exe
                        "C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\python.exe"
      Add arguments (optional):"C:\Users\..\script.py"

To edit:

   In Task scheduler, in the left-hand pane: click 'Task Scheduler Library' (under [Clock Icon] Task Scheduler (Local)) > Find the task name > right-click > properties

The operation completed successfully. (0x0)

NOTE: It might be a good idea to set-up your script to print information to a file instead of stdout. That way, you can see the output when you run the script.

If you right-click > run task in Task Scheduler, but the task does not run, check the password for the user for the task. If the password was changed, the task won't run:

NOTE: If you change your Windows password, you have to re-input your password into Windows Task Scheduler:
    Right-click any of your tasks > Properties > OK > Type in your new password



(0x1) Statuses:
    - Apparently, you should not use letter drive paths... you must use UNC paths or else you will get this error status.
    - EXCEPT if the UNC path is referring to the server where you're running the scheduled scripts from. In this case, use C drive path

  If you disable a task while it is running it does not stop the current execution, the current process will continue to run until it finishes.

  Just all next scheduled executions will be disabled.

  If you run a task manually and don't want it to start again automatically while your manual run is still processing, you can setup the task to apply the rule "do not start a new instance if the task is already running" (however, this is the default config when you create a new task).
