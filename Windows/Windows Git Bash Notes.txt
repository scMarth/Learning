Setting up subl command for Sublime Text

    Open git bash
        
        cd ~
        vi .bash_profile

    Add the following line:
        alias subl="/c/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 3/subl.exe"

    Save + Quit

    Restart git bash and

        subl .

    should work


    NOTE: DO NOT use:
        alias subl="/c/Program\ Files/Sublime\ Text\ 3/sublime_text.exe"

            On Windows, those two executables are different things; the first is the actual application itself, and the second is a small stub application that communicates requests to the running application (launching Sublime as needed) and then terminates.

            Since you're executing sublime_text.exe here, bash is unhelpfully waiting until you quit Sublime before it returns control back to you. If you modify your alias to execute subl.exe instead (it's in the same location) then subl.exe will talk to the running Sublime and immediately terminate, so that bash can continue.

Open explorer in current directory:

    explorer .


NOTE: If you are having trouble building with Git Bash, specifically with build systems and npm, you might want to make sure you're not CD'ing into a UNC path, and instead make sure to CD into a drive letter path.
