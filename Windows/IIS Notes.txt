IIS Manager:

Create and share a folder on a web server:
    On the server, create a folder, e.g.
        C:\inetpub\wwwroot\StreetSweeping

    Right click the folder in Windows Explorer -> Properties -> Sharing Tab -> Share -> (select who you want to share it with)

    Don't forget to add permissions:

    Right click the folder in Windows Explorer -> Security -> Edit -> Add (whoever you want to give permissions)



Setting up a reverse proxy server:

    I started by hosting a web application on my Fedora laptop and making it public to the network. (Connected to the WiFi)

    So on the laptop, if I typed 'localhost/php/hello.php' in the browser, I got a page with 'Hello this is a test foo bar'

    Next, I did ifconfig and found the IP Address (inet) there may be multiple.

    On the server you want acting as a reverse proxy, find the IP address of the web server that is visible to that server, for me it was 172.20.205.203

    Make sure that on the server that will be the reverse proxy, you can go to '172.20.205.203/php/hello.php' and see 'Hello this is a test foo bar'

    On the reverse proxy server, go to IIS Manager, pick the web application that you want to forward to the server with the web app, then
        Double-click URL Rewrite > Add Rule(s) > Reverse Proxy > Inbound Rules 'Enter the server name or the IP address...' type in '172.20.205.203'
            Check Rewrite the domain names of the links in HTTP responses
            From: 172.20.205.203 to dev2.us

            double click the inbound rule
                change pattern to '^(.*)$'
                apply

            double click outbound rule
                under 'Match':
                    Match the content within:
                        check Base (href attribute) and leave defaults.
                apply

    now my fedora web app is visible when i go to 'https://dev2.us/' in a browser
