    setlocal enabledelayedexpansion may be necessary if you're doing some processing in a for loop

    for loops and setdelayedexpansion doesn't play nice with exclamation marks in filenames apparently

    for loops are processed as a whole but somehow, calling subroutines breaks out of the for loop

When writing batch scripts, look out for processing files with special characters in filenames: !@#$%^&*()
