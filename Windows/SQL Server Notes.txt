    "I read somewhere that Microsoft allows for information to remain even after an uninstall. Apparently these vestigial files and folders confuse a subsequent install enough to believe the client networking libraries are already present and so they are not installed."

    SQL Server Network Configuration is for configuring the SQL Server process, i.e. the actual database server, which is a Windows Service.

    SQL Server Native Client Configuration is for configuring the SQL Server Client tools, e.g. SQL Server Management Studio, which is an executable program.

    Why TCP/IP is Disabled in Network ?

    After the SQL Slammer worm a lot of stuff has been disabled out of the box from SQL Server 2005 on, some other ones that are disabled are xp_cmdshell, ad-hoc queries etc etc

    You need to enable TCP/IP and make sure you are not blocking port 1433(this is the default port)

    Yes, Tcp/Ip refers to whether or not the server will be accessible from remote via Tcp/Ip. You can still access the server locally if it is disabled.

    So if I was trying to allow a web application on a different computer connect to the SQL Server computer, I would need to enable say TCP/IP for both Server Network Configuration and Native Client?

    On the SQL Server machine, you would enable TCP/IP under SQL Server Network configuration.

    An SQL Server instance is a complete SQL server and you can install many instances on a machine but you can have only 1 default instance.

    An SQL Server instance has its own copy of the server files, databases and security credentials.
